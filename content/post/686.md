在[麦田音乐网](http://www.mtyyw.com/feizhuliuyinyue/in-my-secret-life-leonard-cohen/)里听到的这首歌  万分感谢

恰好在BBC上看到新闻 Cohen最近在西班牙Valencia演出时因食物中毒晕倒在舞台上, 幸好治疗后已逐渐康复

我们仍然需要这样的声音

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">**"In My Secret Life"**

I saw you this morning.
You were moving so fast.
Can’t seem to loosen my grip
On the past.
And I miss you so much.
There’s no one in sight.
And we’re still making love
In My Secret Life.

I smile when I’m angry.
I cheat and I lie.
I do what I have to do
To get by.
But I know what is wrong,
And I know what is right.
And I’d die for the truth
In My Secret Life.

Hold on, hold on, my brother.
My sister, hold on tight.
I finally got my orders.
I’ll be marching through the morning,
Marching through the night,
Moving cross the borders
Of My Secret Life.

Looked through the paper.
Makes you want to cry.
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die.
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it’s either black or white.
Thank G-d it’s not that simple
In My Secret Life.

I bite my lip.
I buy what I’m told:
From the latest hit,
To the wisdom of old.
But I’m always alone.
And my heart is like ice.
And it’s crowded and cold
In My Secret Life.</span></span>
