The long-awaited Hobbit movie, first mooted over a decade ago by New Zealand
director Peter Jackson, is edging its way towards the screen.

The adaptation of JRR Tolkien&rsquo;s 1937 novel is set to be split into two films
which are scheduled for release in 2010 and 2011 - despite some fairly
unequivocal denials from both Jackson and New Line Studios as recently as a
month ago.

The production has been repeatedly derailed by rights issues and Jackson&rsquo;s
desire to remake King Kong for Universal Pictures, which soured relations
between New Line and the director.

Jackson will be producing the new films, with a director yet to be appointed.
No casting details are expected to emerge for quite some time.
