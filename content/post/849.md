安立奎的这首歌  少了他标志性的激昂旋律  少了性感的唱腔  却也有一种特别的味道

开头的吉他旋律 配合得恰到好处

是一种真诚的味道

You
Do you remember me like I remember you
Do you spend your life
Going back in your mind to the time

Coz I
I walk the streets alone
I hear people in my own
and everyone can see that
I really felt and I'm going throught hell
thinking about you was somebody else

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes I won't think you will see
That somebody's me
That somebody's me

How
How did we go wrong
It was so good and now it's gone
Then I pray at night
that our passing will cross
what we had is a lost
Coz you're always my dear in my thoughts

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes at someday you will see
That somebody's me oh yeah

You'll always be in my life
Even if I'm not in your life
It's in my memory

You when you remember me
And before you set me free
Oh listen please

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that someday you will see
That somebody's me
(yeaaheeyeeh)
Somebody's me
Thats somebody's me
Thats somebody's me
oh yeah
